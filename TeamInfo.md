## Project Summary
Web application to help users find academic papers by performing a vector search on a database of paper abstracts. We will use semantic search to understand the meaning behind user queries, providing more relevant and contextually accurate results. Users can create accounts to save their searches, manage lists of papers, and securely store their usernames and passwords.

Additionally, the platform will allow users to vote on the relevance of the papers they receive, enabling continuous fine-tuning of the search algorithm for improved accuracy. The application will also feature a leaderboard displaying the top papers of the day, week, and month, highlighting trending research and helping users discover the most popular literature within the specified timeframes. This combination of interactive feedback and dynamic content presentation enhances the overall user experience, making it easier for researchers, students, and professionals to find and engage with relevant academic papers.
