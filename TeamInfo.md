## Project Summary
This project is a web application to help users find academic papers by performing a vector search on a database of paper abstracts. Users will create an account to save their liked papers.

Additionally, the platform will allow users to vote on the relevance of the papers they receive, enabling continuous fine-tuning of the search algorithm for improved accuracy. The application will also feature a leaderboard displaying the top papers of the day and of all time, highlighting trending research and helping users discover the most popular literature within the specified timeframes. This combination of interactive feedback and dynamic content presentation enhances the overall user experience, making it easier for researchers, students, and professionals to find and engage with relevant academic papers.
